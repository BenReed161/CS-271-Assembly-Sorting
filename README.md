# CS-271-Assembly-Sorting
A program that I created for CS 271 an Assembly class that I took at Oregon State University. 
The assignment outlined that we needed to generate and array defined by the user that contains certain random numbers generated from 100 to 999.
It will show the user the list in full, as well as the median of the list, as well as a sorted version ion decending order. The sorting is very basic as it conducts
multiple swaps and comparisons on the each array until it is sorted.
This program is using the Intel x86 Assembly Architecture using the "Irvine32" ASM library.
